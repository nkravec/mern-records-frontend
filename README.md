# mern-records-frontend

Vite + React 18 + Tailwind frontend, adapted from MongoDB's official
[mern-stack-example](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/mern-stack-example)
(Apache-2.0). Part of a two-repo test rig (`mern-records-backend` /
`mern-records-frontend`) used to validate that a Vite/React toolchain
(including native esbuild/rollup binaries) builds and serves correctly on
an arm64 (Apple Silicon / VMware Fusion) self-hosted GitHub Actions runner.
Not a product — a validation harness.

## Local run

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev        # dev server on localhost:5173, proxies /record to localhost:5050
```

Requires `mern-records-backend` running locally for the app to actually
load data (see that repo's README) — not required just to build/serve the
frontend on its own.
